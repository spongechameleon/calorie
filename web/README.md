# Feature To-Do
- Mobile styling
- Meal calculator
  - Should be able to add ingredients by [name, amount, calories, protein]
  - Should be able to specify amount used of ingredient, calculate totals via ratio
  - Should be able to add manual ingredients
  - Should be able to add saved ingredients (autofill)
  - Config: should be able to save individual ingredients by name, amount, calories, protein
- `try/catch` all calls to `window.localStorage`
  - Could run into quota, permissions exceptions
- Turn into a PWA for offline use
- Sync with another web `count-dracula` when on the same network (WebRTC -> snapdrop?)

# Bugs
- Edit mode styling is different from display mode styling
- `<select>` dropdown should reset after `Add Meal`
